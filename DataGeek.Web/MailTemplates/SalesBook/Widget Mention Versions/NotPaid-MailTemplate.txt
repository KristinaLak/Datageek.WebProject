Dear %name%,

I am pleased to advise that the %issue% issue is now live and can be viewed by visiting our website via the attached link.

%link%

You can find your advertisement on page %pageno%.

On checking our records, I note that our Invoice No: <b>%invoice%</b> remains unpaid and request that you make arrangements to settle this account by return.  
Once payment has been made, please e-mail a copy of the proof of payment to: <a href="mailto:%finance_contact%">%finance_contact%</a>.

In one to two weeks the brochure for %feature% will be completed and uploaded to our websites under Reports > Company Reports. %feature% will also receive their brochure in the form of a widget which they can upload to their website. All publications of this brochure will include your advertisement. 

Thank you for your participation in our digital magazine.</font>
