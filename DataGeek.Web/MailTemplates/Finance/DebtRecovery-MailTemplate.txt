Dear %name%,

<center><font size="5" color="red">Debt Recovery Notice Amount %outstanding%</font></center>

We have been passed your file from WDM Accounts and is now being handled by the Litigation Department.   

It is clear that despite previous requests to obtain payment, you have decided to withhold settlement. Unless payment is received direct into our bank within the next Seven Days instructions will be given to commence immediate proceedings without any further reference to you. Any additional costs including interest of 6% above UK base rate will be liable by you. 

Should any legal action be  taken, this could adversely affect your credit rating and may make obtaining credit in the future very difficult.

To avoid this potential damaging situation please arrange payment by the due date.

Please contact our finance team member by email at %finance_contact_e% or directly by phone at %finance_contact_p% with payment details.</font>
