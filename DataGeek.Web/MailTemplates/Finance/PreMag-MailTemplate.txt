Dear %name%,

Your advertising insertion in our %issue% magazine is due to be published on %pub_date% and we have been unable to establish when payment of our Invoice No: <b>%invoice%</b> will be made.

All of our client advertising is subject to 'payment upon order confirmation', so it is imperative for us to receive cleared funds in advance of the publications going live on the Internet.

May I apologise in advance if payment has already been made and I would be grateful if you could forward a copy of the proof of payment to <a href="mailto:%finance_contact%">%finance_contact%</a>.

Once again, thank you for your participation in our digital magazine.</font>
