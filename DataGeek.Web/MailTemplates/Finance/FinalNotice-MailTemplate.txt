Dear %name%,

<center><font size="5" color="red">FINAL NOTICE</font></center>

Despite previous attempts to recover the amount due of <b>%outstanding%</b> outstanding in respect of invoice no. <b>%invoice%</b> (%invoice_date%), this amount has not yet been received.

Unless payment is received by cleared funds into our bank by %deadline%, this account will automatically be passed to our solicitor with instructions to commence immediate recovery action.

This action which we have tried to avoid will attract interest of 6% above the UK base rate as indicated in our terms and conditions. Additionally any legal fees incurred will also be liable by you. 

Any legal action taken may seriously affect your credit rating and you may have difficulty obtaining credit in the future.

Please contact our finance team member by email at %finance_contact_e% or directly by phone at %finance_contact_p% with payment details.

We can only hope that your payment is received in time.</font>
