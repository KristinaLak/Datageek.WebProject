Dear %name%,

I am pleased to advise that the %issue% issue is now live and can be viewed by visiting our website via the attached link.

%link%

Our Design department did not receive any artwork for this edition and have placed a filler in the magazine on Page %pageno%. As you will be liable for the cost of this filler, I would be grateful if you could forward your artwork to <a href="mailto:%design_contact%">%design_contact%</a> by return so your own advertisement can be featured in our digital magazine.

In one to two weeks the brochure for %feature% will be completed and uploaded to our websites under Reports > Company Reports. All publications of this brochure will include your advertisement. 

Thank you for your participation in our digital magazine.</font>
